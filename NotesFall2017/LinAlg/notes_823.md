# Notes 8/23

# Matrices and Vectors
    Indices designated by row by column
    t[23] is 2nd row, 3rd column in a 1-based indices system.
    t[12] is the same index in a 0th based indices system.
    Listen, 0th based indices are superior. (This is subjective.)

# Addition
    Same size, nothing else
    Elementwise

# Subtraction
    Not comutative
    Subtract elementwise
    Same size

# Problems
       [4, 3]        [2, 1]           [ 8,  13]
A = [7, 5]  B = [0, 3] AB = [14, 22]

# Transpose
    Flip over the diagonal
    
# Multiplication
    Internal dimensions must be the same
    Vectors can only be multiplied row x column or column x row
    Scalar = Scalar * All Elements
